## Database Creation & Schema Design

**Database Creation**  :
Created an E-commerce database named `ecommerce_db` to simulate real-world online retail operations.
```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;

-- Use the database
USE ecommerce_db;
```
**Table Design**  :
Designed and implemented normalized relational tables for:
- Categories  
- Products  
- Customers  
- Orders  
- Order_Items  
- Shipping_Details  

**Relationships & Constraints**  :
Established foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity between products, categories, customers, and orders.

**Data Population**  :
Inserted realistic sample data across all tables to represent actual e-commerce transactions and customer behavior.

## Table Creation :
```sql
-- Create the categories table
CREATE TABLE Categories (
    category_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    category_name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Create the products table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INT,
    category_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Categories(category_id)
);

-- Create the customers table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(255),
    last_name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    address VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Create the orders table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    status ENUM('pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered') DEFAULT 'pending',
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

-- Create the order_items table
CREATE TABLE Order_Items (
    order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);

-- Create the shipping_details table
CREATE TABLE Shipping_Details (
    shipping_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    order_id INT,
    address VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(100),
    zipcode VARCHAR(20),
    country VARCHAR(100),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id)
);

```

## Data Analysis & Findings

**Q.1 Write a SQL query to find the total number of orders placed by each customer ?**

```sql
SELECT o.customer_id,concat(first_name,' ',last_name) as full_name,COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders as o
join customers as c
on o.customer_id=c.customer_id
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
**Q.2. Write a SQL query to retrieve all orders placed in 2024 ?**

```sql
select *
from orders
where year(order_date)=2024;
```
**Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculat the total revenue generated by each product ?**

```sql
select p.product_name,sum(oi.quantity*oi.price) as total_sales
from products as p
join order_items as oi
on p.product_id=oi.product_id
group by p.product_name;
```
**Q.4 Write a SQL query to calculate the monthly total sales for the business ?**

```sql
SELECT YEAR(o.order_date) AS year,MONTH(o.order_date) AS month,SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi
ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date)
ORDER BY year, month;
```

**Q.5 How many products are there in each category ?**

```sql
select category_name, count(*) as total_products
from products
join categories
on products.category_id = categories.category_id
group by category_name;
```

**Q.6 Find the orders of all customers whose order status is shipped ?**

```sql
select *
from customers
join orders
using (customer_id)
where status = "Shipped";
```

**Q.7 Find which cities generate the highest revenue ?**

```sql
SELECT sd.city,SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN shipping_details sd 
ON o.order_id = sd.order_id
GROUP BY sd.city
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

**Q.8 Identify the top 5 customers who have paid the highest total amount ?**

```sql
select c.customer_id,concat(first_name,'  ',last_name) as full_name, sum(total_amount) as total_amt
from customers as c
join orders as o
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
join order_items as od
on o.order_id = od.order_id
group by o.customer_id
order by total_amt desc
limit 5;
```

**Q.9 Show top 3 category with the highest total sales generated ?**

```sql
select category_name,sum(oi.quantity*oi.price) as Total_sales
from categories as c
join products as p
on c.category_id=p.category_id
join order_items as oi
on p.product_id=oi.product_id
group by category_name
order by Total_sales desc
limit 3;
```

**Q.10 Write a SQL query to find the total number of customers who purchased items from each category ?**

```sql
SELECT c.category_name,COUNT(distinct o.customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi 
ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p 
ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN categories c 
ON p.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY c.category_name;
```
